This whole effort is mostly about Writing to Learn - in order to write, I have to think [more] clearly. Additional benefits (to me) include: a single process for publishing my writing and a canonical destination/location so I can rediscover stuff I've sort of forgotten about "oh I know I worked with/wrote about _foo_ before, where did I put that?".

## About Me

In my professional life I wear/have worn many "hats" (Engineer/Developer, Architect, Consultant/SME) and work in various different subdisciplines, of which the most common are:

* Platform/Infrastructure Engineering
* CI/CD Pipeline Engineering
* Security Engineering
* Test Automation
* Metrics/Monitoring/Alerting/Observability
* (Systems) Architecture

But I've done and am interested in many areas of tech work that do not fit easily in these sorts of "Role" categories; the most accurate description I can give is necessarily rather imprecise:
* My "customers" are typically (internal) Software Engineering teams.
* I find ways to use my experience/knowledge/skills to help them build/run the software that they build.

Now I admit that's a bit vague, but I hope it gives some useful context to those who are techie (or techie-adjacent) enough to be interested in reading the sort of material that I'm likely to publish here.

## About this site

Here is a list of some software, written by not-me, that I've used to make/publish this website:

* [Hugo, static site generator](https://gohugo.io/)
* [Hextra(Hugo Theme)](https://imfing.github.io/hextra)
* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
* [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

More details available at [How this Site was Made](../articles/this-site.md)

## Other notes

1. In most of the (tech) material here, I generally presume:

  - basic terminal/cli skills
  - basic text editor skills
  - some exposure to linux/unix-like systems

  If you are missing any of the above or want a refresher, you might want to try looking around the web.

  <!-- TODO: list some intro to linux/cli tutorials on the web -->

2. In sections that represent cli input/output or code snippets:

  - The `<carets>` indicate tokens to be substituted by actual values.
  - The `[brackets]` indicate optional parameters.
