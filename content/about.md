## About Me

In my professional life I wear/have worn many "hats" (Engineer/Developer, Architect, Consultant/SME) and work in various different subdisciplines, of which the most common are:

* Platform/Infrastructure Engineering
* CI/CD Pipeline Engineering
* Security Engineering
* Test Automation
* Metrics/Monitoring/Alerting/Observability
* (Systems) Architecture

But I've done and am interested in many areas of tech work that do not fit easily in these sorts of "Role" categories; the most accurate description I can give is necessarily rather imprecise:
* My "customers" are typically (internal) Software Engineering teams.
* I find ways to use my experience/knowledge/skills to help them build/run the software that they build.

Now I admit that's a bit vague, but I hope it gives some useful context to those who are techie (or techie-adjacent) enough to be interested in reading the sort of material that I'm likely to publish here.

## About this site's content

My main[^extra] purpose for creating this content is "Writing to Learn"; writing helps me to think [more] clearly, to better understand the material and my own opinions/thought process. Therefore, the principal target audiences are: _me_ and _future me_. Of course, I'd like to think that others might get benefit from this effort as well. But I try to write for my audience.

[^extra]: Additional benefits (to me) include: a single process for publishing my writing and a canonical destination/location so I can more easily rediscover information/thoughts I've sort of forgotten about: "oh I know I worked with/wrote about _foo_ before, where did I put that?".

## Other notes

1. In most of the (tech) material here, I generally presume:

    - some exposure to linux/unix-like systems
    - basic terminal/cli skills
    - basic text editor skills
    - basic familiarity with Version Control Systems(VCS) especially `git` and "code forge" software such as github, gitlab, forgejo, etc.
    - some exposure to networking concepts, especially HTTP and DNS

2. When you see capitalized forms such as "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", etc., I'm using terminology from [RFC2219](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) which establishes language around requirement levels.

3. In sections that represent cli input/output or code snippets:

    - The `<carets>` indicate tokens to be substituted by actual values.
    - The `[brackets]` indicate optional parameters.

## Other Resources I like

* [Beej's Guide to Networking Concepts](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet0/)[^beej_sockets]
* [Mozilla's overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

[^beej_sockets]: Not to be confused with [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) , which is about socket _programming_
  <!-- TODO: list some intro to linux/cli tutorials on the web -->
