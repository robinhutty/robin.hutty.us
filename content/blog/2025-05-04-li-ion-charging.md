title: Charging Li-ion powerbanks

Since my region has had problematic power outages recently, I'm thinking about rechargeable batteries and powerbanks;

It's generally accepted that rechargeable batteries for modern consumer electronics[^cell-types] degrade faster if they're frequently charged to 100% of nominal capacity. Indeed, so much so that battery manufacturers specify _lifespan_ in terms of the number of cycles to reach 80% of the rated battery capacity. In addition, "Simply storing lithium-ion batteries in the charged state also reduces their capacity".

[^cell-types]: See the categorization of lithium ion cell chemistries in the table in Wikipedia's [list of battery types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_types)

And that's why various operating systems, both general purpose OSen such as linux/macos and more specialty OSen (Android, EV, other embedded systems), support limiting charge to less than full capacity.

But I have quite a few rechargeable batteries that do _not_ support that functionality. Off the top of my head, I can think of many in my home, two powerbanks (the sort that are marketed for recharging mobile phones), an amp for my cello/bass guitar, an ebook reader, a shop light, multiple headsets/headphones/earbuds, a toothbrush, a shaver, a couple camping lanterns, and piles (ha, multi-language pun!) of rechargeable AAs/AAAs. I suspect that (a) there are more and (b) that this is not way out of line for middle income households in the US.

## Scheduled Charging

So how about putting the less-frequently used devices to be charged on a schedule? Many modern power strips come with USB-A and USB-C ports and I can plug the power strip itself into a smart plug that only turns on for a few hours per day? or even per week?

Would that extend the life of these batteries? Without the disadvantage of having insufficiently charged devices when I want to use them?
